      <p>A Certificate Signing Program allows Institutions to digitally sign and secure their Students Certificates. Institutions on the Network are able to upload their students Certificates to the Blockchain Network, which signs and hash the Certificate into a hash code issued to their respective Students. 
        These blockchain allows the creation of account by Institutions and only the institutions can upload certificates. These restraints are by default by the Certificate Signing Program on the blockchain network.
        <br><br> This blockchain model for a Certificate Signing Program enhances the value of Certificates to Organizations and brings in new value to the Institutions by creating trusted Certificates. 
        
        <br><br> In this code pattern, we will create a Certificate Signing Program as a blockchain web application using Hyperledger Composer API and Node.js. The application will allow members to register on the network where they will create their account.
        They will be identified on the network with their account number and will create a access key which they will use to sign in. This access key is used as the card id for the member to make uploads and query records. The member once signed
        in, can make upload certificates on the network. They can view their uploaded records as part of the blockchain ledger. This code pattern illustrates the use of permissions as part of the network where a
        member can only view their own records.
        
        <br><br> Organizations on the other hand, will only need the hash code of a certificate to query the blockchain ledger. Once a matching hashcode is found on network we immediately return the associated student data and a link to view or download the Certificatecd.
